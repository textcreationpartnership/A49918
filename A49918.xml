            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HE heard Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſay to Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> That he could give no further Inſtructions that night; for that he was to go that night to <hi>Knights-bridge,</hi> and when Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was gone, <hi>Smith</hi> asked <hi>Everard</hi> whither Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was gone that night? He ſaid, he was gone to the Lord <hi>Howard of Eſcricks</hi> Houſe at <hi>Knights-bridge;</hi> And further ſaith not.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Everard</hi>'s Evidence ſaith, That he asked when he ſhould compleat his Inſtructions? <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> told him, That he could not do it that Night, nor the next Morning, for that he was to go to <hi>Knights-bridge</hi> that night, or the morrow morning; and afterwards told him, he was to go to the Lord <hi>Howards of Eſcrick</hi> at <hi>Knights-bridge;</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> came the next day towards night, and compleated the ſaid Libel, and corrected it in ſeveral places: And Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> ſaith, at the finiſhing of this Libel, <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> gave <hi>Everard</hi> directions to take the <hi>Quaeries</hi> out of a Printed Pamphlet called, <hi>The Intercepted Letter to Roger L'Strange,</hi> and to inſert them into the ſaid Libel.</p>

Mrs. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſaith, She ſaw the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> at her Husband's Lodgings (ſome ſhort time before her Husband was made Priſoner) deliver a Paper to her Husband, and ſaid, <hi>They were notable Heads;</hi> and withal ſaid, <hi>That when thoſe things were put in order, the People would riſe, and then they would ſeize the King, and keep him until he had paſſed the Bill of Excluding the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>and ſettling the Succeſſion upon the Duke of</hi> Monmouth. And ſaith, (reading the Paper left in her Husband's Chamber by the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi>) ſhe remembers theſe Expreſſions in that Paper; <hi>As it was the undoubted Right of the People to oppoſe a Popiſh Succeſſor, ſo it was to oppoſe a Poſſeſſor that would follow evil Council, and not be ruled by his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:</hi> At which time Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> call'd for a Pen and Ink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and told his Wife that he had promiſed not to deliver that Paper in that hand; and ſhe asking whither he was going? her Husband anſwered, He was going to Mr. <hi>Everard</hi>'s Chamber to have that Paper drawn up. And before the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> went out of Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Chamber, Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> asked the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> what he ſhould do for money? to which the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> replied, <hi>Let me alone for that:</hi> And that within a day or two her Husband brought home the Libel to his Wife, and read it to her; upon the reading of which, ſhe asked him whether <hi>Everard</hi> had drawn that Book out of thoſe few Heads? her Husband anſwered, Yes; for that Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> was a man of Parts.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Terriſha Peacock</hi> ſaith, that being in her Maſters Chamber, or Dining-room, ſhe found the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> in the Dining-room, and ſaw the Lord give her Maſter a Paper, and told him it was a notable thing, and bid him read it; and ſaid, <hi>If this were once Publiſhed about, the People would riſe, and then we will ſeize upon the King, and keep him, until ſuch time as he paſſes the Bill, concerning the Excluſion of the</hi> Duke of York; <hi>and ſettle the Crown upon the</hi> Duke of Monmouth; And Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> asking him what he ſhould do for Money? The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ſaid, <hi>Mr.</hi> Fitz-Harris <hi>ſhould have enough within a Week;</hi> and ſhe ſaith, he gave it for his Wife to Read; and after ſhe ſaw her Maſter Copy it out; and asking whether he would come in to Dinner? He anſwered, he had earneſt buſineſs at <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> whither he was going.</p>
